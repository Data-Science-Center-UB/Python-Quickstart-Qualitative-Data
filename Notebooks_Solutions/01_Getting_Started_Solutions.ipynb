    "Variables can store different types of data. In Python, **data types** define the kind of value a variable holds. The type tells Python how to store the value in memory and what you can do with it. In the example below, we’ll define some variables for the details of a shed construction site and use the **comment** symbol `#` to explain what each variable represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `supervisor` variable is of **string (`str`)** type. That is a sequence of characters used to store text. It must be enclosed in matching quotation marks. To create a long text across multiple lines, use triple quotes: `'''`.\n",
    "- Python supports two main numeric types: `int` and `float`.\n",
    "    - An **integer (`int`)** is a whole number without a decimal point, such as 3 or 2025.\n",
    "    - A **float (`float`)** is a number with a decimal point, like 2.5 or 0.75.\n",
    "- A **boolean (`bool`)** represents a truth value: either `True` or `False` (capitalized). It's often used to represent binary states, such as yes/no, on/off, or installed/not installed."
