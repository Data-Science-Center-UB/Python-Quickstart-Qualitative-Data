# Python Quickstart for Qualitative Data

This repository provides hands-on, self-learning notebooks for starting to use Python for working with qualitative data. It builds on the basics covered in [Python Foundations via Mind Map](https://github.com/Data-Science-Center-UB/Python-Foundations-via-Mind-Map/) and applies them to the very basics of common qualitative workflows: reading text sources, organizing and coding data, and producing simple summaries. Short examples and small exercises make concepts concrete. Notebooks were prepared with greatest care, but no guarantee of correctness can be given.

>About the project
>
>This repository was developed and delivered as part of workshops within the framework of the DataNord project at the Data Science Center of the University of Bremen. The DataNord project is funded under the grant number 16DKZ2026A by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) >and financed by the European Union – NextGenerationEU. It is part of a broader initiative to strengthen data literacy among researchers by offering practical, hands-on training in core areas of 1) data science, 2) research data management (RDM), 3) critical thinking, and 4) ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA).
