# Python Introduction for Qualitative Research

This repository provides a self-learning notebook series for starting to use Python for qualitative research. It first covers the core building blocks of programming with Python that are also illustrated in the mindmap: variables, data types, control flow, and functions. The notebooks then dive into the very basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP): reading text sources, preprocessing text, and simple analyses.

The repository consists of:

/Notebooks (Jupyter notebooks including unsolved exercises that reinforce learning) <br>
/Notebooks_Solutions (Jupyter notebooks including exercises with solutions) <br>
/Images (images loaded in the Jupyter notebooks including the Python mind map) <br>
/Data (datasets loaded in the Jupyter notebooks) <br>
Data_References.txt (provides references for the datasets included in the /Data folder) <br>
SETUP.md (orientation for Python installation and environment management)

>About the project
>
>This repository was developed and delivered as part of workshops within the framework of the DataNord project at the Data Science Center of the University of Bremen. The DataNord project is funded under the grant number 16DKZ2026A by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) >and financed by the European Union – NextGenerationEU. It is part of a broader initiative to strengthen data literacy among researchers by offering practical, hands-on training in core areas of 1) data science, 2) research data management (RDM), 3) critical thinking, and 4) ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA). The materials were developed by Annika Nolte and Nele Fuchs.
